# Darvy: Local Cat Adoption

### 
**Group Members:** Darius Beckford, Ivy Bowers

This website is a home page for Darvy, a local cat adoption center. We include a handy navigation bar with application options, an engaging and informational banner, a concise card-list of cats available, newsletter subscription options for interested viewers, and a nicely formatted footer for all contact/FAQ needs. Easily find our website among other tabs with our new tab Favicon, clearly displaying the logo of Darvy. This page is pure html and CSS with 4 newly added actions/interactivity buttons using JavaScript. These actions are: "Learn More" about each available cat, "Favorite" or "Star" your favorite cats to a list reachable in the NavBar, a "Clear Favorites" button to clear any list you've made in the "Cats"/Favorites tab of the navbar, and a "Subscribe" button to be added to the Darvy Newsletter.

### Major Sections in the page:
- [Darius] Fixed Position Navbar: Our navigation bar at the top of the page will remain fixed as you scroll through the page. In the left corner we have a clean, recognizable logo for Darvy. Clickable options on the right include Home, About, Contact, Cats available, and Apply for users inquiring about an adoption application.
- [Darius] Banner: The banner includes a drawing of an orange cat resting on a bed and an engaging introduction to what Darvy's mission is as a organization.
- [Ivy] Adoptee Display: Here we have a card/tile structure to display all of the cats currently available for adoption including each of their names, ages, and an image. Below this information is a clickable button to "Learn More" about each cat.
- [Ivy] Communication: This section gives the viewer an option to sign up for the company's newsletter to recieve information on cat availibility/wellbeing and location/hours of operation updates. There is an input field to subscribe the user's email to the newsletter on a beautiful orange cat background.
- [Darius] Footer: The footer also includes the same logo as the fixed navbar for consistency and visual-appeal as well as the business' tagline "Local cat adoption, made simple." Below this are numerous options for inforamtion on "Adopt"-ing a cat, "About" the business and how to contact them, and "Help" for any questions user's may have about resources, volunteering, and donating.
